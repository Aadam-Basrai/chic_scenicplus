In this section we present several tutorials on using SCENIC+.

**From count matrix and fragments file to enhancer driven gene regulatory network (eGRN)**

For getting started with SCENIC+, we recommend this tutorial covering the entire SCENIC+ workflow 
including preprocessing steps. For this tutorial we make use of the 3k PBMCs multiome dataset publicly 
available from 10x Genomics. We'll cover scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq preprocessing, topic modeling, motif enrichment 
analysis, running SCENIC+ and basic downsream analysis.
